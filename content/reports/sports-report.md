> Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.

The sports year 2019 kick-started in July 2019 with the most awaited Intra Ground Football Tournament. The six-day tournament concluded with BE Production bagging the 1st place and BE Electronics, TE Computers claiming 2nd and 3rd places respectively.

In August 2019 our next event was the Intra Badminton tournament which took place at Andheri sports complex. The Month of September saw the table tennis enthusiasts battling it out at our third intra event. With TE Computers, BE Production and BE IT capturing the first, second and third position from the boys as well as BE IT, BE Electronics and BE Production winning in the girl’s category. With these 3 intra events, our odd semester came to an end and the new semester was awaiting for many more exciting events that we planned to offer to students both, from our college and from outside. Months of hard-work and Meticulous planning for our annual Sports festival ATHLOS was underway. Our sports fest involved various sports like Throwball, basketball, ground football, rink football as well as numerous indoor games like Table Tennis, Chess and Carrom. From inviting over 30 colleges to participate in organizing these numerous events at different locations, Athlos was a complete and grand success.

Along with this, the even semester had various Intra events in store for our students. We organized various events in the month of January. Rink Football and Throwball events in the girl's category. Carrom in both the girl's as well as the boy's category. More importantly, after four years, we organized the intra cricket tournament which went on for over a span of 6 days. The zeal and teamwork shown by our students gave us our winners TE Electronics, BE Production and TE Production. Sports Day was conducted on 1st February at the famous Mumbai University Ground. The event commenced with various athletic events, Relay races, Shot putt and the Tug of War. With our final two events intra-Basketball and Intra-Volleyball, our sports year finally concluded. Participation in sports was always aimed at bringing numerous benefits for participants. The enthusiasm and dedication that went in not just organizing an event but also for the students to thoroughly enjoy the event giving a fair chance to each class to battle it out for the coveted Sports Trophy proved to be the most challenging. But with countless suggestions from the students and the endless support given to us during the time of preparations, every event concluded smoothly.
