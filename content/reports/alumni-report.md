The Alumni Committee of Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering (Fr. CRCE) functions to strengthen the bond between the Institute and its Alumni. A strong Alumni base is one of the formidable strengths for any elite institute. Thereby, the Committee acts as a platform where the existing students and the Alumni can interact for a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship. Our prime objective is to foster relations between the Alumni and the Institute and strengthen the bond between Alumni and current students.

The Committee organizes various events such as the Annual Alumni Meet and interaction programs to keep the Alumni in constant touch with the institute and also help them in networking among themselves. The Committee also tracks and highlights the achievements and success of Alumni so as to provide impetus to the Institute and its students. Moreover, the committee acts as facilitator and provides administrative help to the Alumni.
