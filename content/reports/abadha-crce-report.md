The name, Abadha, literally translating to “unbound”, embodies the spirit of the team and its creation. Team Abadha builds a One-Manned All-Terrain Vehicle which is capable of keeping its ground in the roughest of terrain and the most challenging conditions, truly doing justice to its name. Each and every bit of the vehicle is designed, analysed, manufactured and tested on performance-based criteria by the engineering students themselves. The buggy built can be viewed as the closest approximation as well as an extreme adaptation of the actual automobile model in use currently.

Team Abadha CRCE participates in one of the largest annual under-graduate level technical competitions named BAJA SAE INDIA in which a large number of elite colleges compete. The buggy built by the team perfectly blends in seamless suspension systems with the powerful transmission which transforms a comparatively modest Briggs & Stratton Engine into a beast. Team Abadha CRCE, founded under the guidance of Prof. D.S.S. Sudhakar in 2012, and propelled to the rise by our faculty advisors, Prof. Hitendra Vaishnav and Prof. M.V.B. Rao as well as all the faculty members of the college, became the first technical team to represent Fr. CRCE at the national level as a pioneer of encouraging students to practically apply the knowledge acquired through the course of four academic years.

Back in the year 2015, the team participated in the International Series of Karting and won the BEST MANUFACTURING AWARD in its first attempt at that competition. In the year 2019, Team Abadha CRCE was able to secure an overall rank of 35th and 2nd in Mumbai in the same competition held in NATRAX, Pithampur. One of the most commendable achievements was that the year's buggy was the lightest, coming down from 480kgs in 2012 to 140kgs in 2019. However, the team brought real glory to the college in the year 2020, when they secured a thumping podium finish bagging an All India Rank FIFTH and bringing home the Winning Trophy for the “Marketing Presentation Event”. In spite of being the smallest team at the competition member wise, the team managed to outclass the rest of the teams with their skill and determination and came out with flying colours in other events too:

4-hour Endurance Race: 8th<br>
Engineering Design: 4th<br>
Acceleration: 5th<br>
Cost Report: 12th<br>
Sledge Pull: 12th<br>

Team Abadha CRCE will always strive to build the best All-Terrain Vehicle by putting into practice the practical knowledge the team has been bestowed with from the faculty advisors as well as our seniors. Next year we see ourselves once again, making it to the podium by securing the FIRST RANK. We look forward to your continuous support and encouragement.
