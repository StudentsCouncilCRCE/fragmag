Established in 2014, PROJECT CELL is an endeavour to promote innovative thinking amidst young minds. We work towards accomplishing tasks that could be gradually developed on a large scale and solve many social problems that exist today. At Project Cell, we tread towards learning new concepts, techniques and gaining practical experiences on implementation of creative ideas out. The main goal of the Cell is to learn new technologies while developing new projects. This year, the team actively participated and conducted the following activities:

1. Hardware Hackathon: All students interested in e-yantra ideas were asked to form a team of 3-4 and make bots to complete the theme.The theme was Mining and Collecting BOT
2. Sensor Workshop: We gave students some sensors and Arduino Board to code them.
3. PCB Workshop: The participants were taught how to make a PCB and solder it
4. Soldering Workshop for Fe’s: This workshop was Compulsory for every Fe to attend. Hence it was conducted for a week, more than 220 students participated in the workshop
5. Alumni Meet: All the Alumni, including the Team Founder and Co-Founders were invited, this was done in order for the junior team members to know about their seniors
6. Simulation of Multisim: In this Workshop the implementation of Multisim to simulate the circuit was taught to the students
7. RoboWars for Fe’s: In this event all the selected candidates from the interview process were asked to participate in this. The teams consisted of 2-3 members and a mentor. More than 5 teams had participated in the event
8. NBA Accreditation: To display our work we prepared around 11 projects in different domains including IoT, Image Processing, Automation etc
9. NAAC Accreditation: We demonstrated 20 working projects all of different domains including ML, Android App development, Image Processing, Sensors etc.

##### Activities Carried out by Project Cell:

1. This year we declared the Project Cell as Team rather than council.
2. Project Cell Teaching: The students were taught sensor interfacing and sending data to the cloud. Different applications like Blynk, IFTTT and cloud protocol were taught in greater depth. The students were also guided in implementing their mini projects. The Students were also asked to focus on coding languages such as python. Different projects on automation such as voice controlled light with Solar panels have been implemented this year. Many realistic projects such as board cleaner, automatic lights and automatic door opening system with RFiD Tag Card as well as Face Unlock were also implemented.
3. We stood in top 20 in e-yrc in one of the themes.
4. The project developed this year from the cell for eYIC was a self balanced walking machine which has a great social cause.
5. The front end of the project cell website was developed.

##### Future Initiatives:

- Effectively utilize the infrastructure and robotics facilities already available in college.
- Make a Project Database i.e. create a database of all projects developed at Project Cell and other curriculum projects, making them easily available to professors and students in future.
- To make our own marketing team and get sponsorships from sponsors.
- To win in e-yrc competition.

Last Note: We the current team are thankful to the faculty and the HoD of electronics dept for guiding us in a proper way, throughout the year. We also thank the director of the college for giving us permission to work in the night and also the department for giving us components i.e. funding in our projects etc. Lastly, bhoir sir for helping us in all possible way
