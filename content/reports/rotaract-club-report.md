The Rotaract Club has been an integral part of Fr.CRCE. This year our club was associated with two NGOs: "BIGGER Than Life" that works towards the education of underprivileged children and women empowerment and "The Swapna Vana Foundation" which works for the cause of reforestation. We work along the motto "Service above Self".

We started our tenure with The Installation ceremony on 24th August 2019 under the guidance of our parent Rotary, Rotary Club of Bombay Bandra and Rotaract District 3141. The installation ceremony was conducted to appreciate the hard work of the previous Rotaractors and felicitate them. The responsibility was then handed over to the incoming Rotaractors which is a ritual followed by all other Rotaract Clubs. We conducted two major events during our college fest, Synergy: Amazing Race and Foot pool. Amazing Race was a treasure hunt held across Bandra wherein the participants were given various clues that led them to the next location and eventually, the final location.Footpool, as the name suggests, is a combination of football and pool. Each participant was given a striker ball which they need to use to dunk the other balls in the pockets in a time limit of 90 seconds. The club then conducted its annual trek – FootSlog. It was conducted to give the students a break from their regular schedule and get closer to nature by enjoying the beautiful mountain top view of Visapur Fort.

These events were followed by Mic Drop 2.0 which was a multi-genre event that witnessed the performances of various artists like SamayRaina (Stand-Up Comedian), YedaAnna (Rapper), SimarSingh (poet) and few other upcoming comedians that were equally loved by the crowd. Along with these events, we’ve had ongoing NGO projects with the NGO Bigger Than Life (BTL) called Our Only Home. It was conducted in order to make the children of the BTL aware of the current global warming crisis.

The club conducted its annual charity run: The Heart and Sole Run 3 on 1st March 2020. Our charity run was conducted in order to spread awareness about the right to education for children and to raise awareness about the importance of planting more trees in order to have a better future. The academic year for our club comes to an end with the event 'Come Together' which will be conducted in order to celebrate the achievements of the club throughout the year and also felicitate our volunteers who have worked during different events conducted throughout the year.

The Rotaract Club of FR. CRCE aims to Make a Difference by helping society in every possible way.
