> "Teamwork is the ability to work together towards a common vision, the ability to direct individual accomplishments towards organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results."

The Students' Council of Fr.CRCE for the year 2019-20 came into being on the 1st May 2019. A council fuelled full of diverse ideas and qualities. The year began even before the academic year started with a relaxing event 'Yoga Day' celebrated on 21st June 2019, as an attempt to cultivate discernment, awareness, self-regulation and higher consciousness in the students, to train their body and mind to self-observe.

Our next event was the Friendship Day that was held on 9th August 2019 with the release of the theme: VILLAINS, because who are villains if not our best friends. This event was intended to give students a stress-free evening away from studies and placements with friends and have a jolly time.

Then followed our flagship and most sought after event in all of India's debating circles, The Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate, CRMD. The theme for the year Ideologies: Egocentrism Engendering Self Abatement was one of the most engaging themes we've had throughout the history of the competition. Thirty-two teams from various parts of the nation battled for the prestigious trophy with the debating prowess. We all take pride in how successful the event turned out to be.

Euphoria began with a storm; we had a website euphoria2020.stucocrce.com developed by our own Web-Master Sakshi Ghadigaonkar. An android app to stay up to date with all events and their intricacies too was also developed by a team led by Darlene Nazreth from TE Computers.

The most awaited festival of fun, music, drama and dance, EUPHORIA 2020, runs across three spirited and fun-filled days (or more) and has drawn a large number of participants from the city. The Cultural Festival is a great mix of events ranging from literary to performing arts, from creative to sports challenges. It is a mix of inter and intra collegiate events wherein the students of our college showcase their skills in the quest of winning the Cultural Trophy.

> To Be or Not To Be Is The Question ¿<br>

The theme refers to everyone who has different ideas, imaginations and expressions. Your Astitva. And also Every Artist Urges and Dreams of The Ultimate Stage, EUPHORIA!

Students' Council of FR. CRCE proudly presented a brand new intercollegiate event Junoon, where those who have skills to use chords and notes to express their emotions competed against each other to be the best. This was followed by Paridhaan the inter-collegiate dance competition, where eight teams gave a cut-throat battle to bag the grand prize.

We also had intra collegiate events, Project Runway: The Fashion Show on 18th February where the divas and hunks of our college walked down the ramp to the theme: Avatara as they channelized their inner supermodels, and the most awaited event was The Intra Collegiate Dance Competition held on 20th February where the vivacious dancers set the floor on fire with their energetic performances, dancing their way to the Cultural Trophy. The drama club showcased a play along with the College Band performance which was followed by the prize distribution. BE IT won the best dance, best fashion show and were declared the overall winners of the cultural fest.

Although academics are important, it doesn’t hurt once in a while to go out and have fun and discover new things and learn outside the classroom. I would like to thank Rev.Fr.Valerian D’Souza, Dr.Srija Unnikrishnan, Dr.Deepak V. Bhoir, the entire staff, faculty and every member from the Students’ council and all the students of CRCE for their endless support and enthusiasm for making this year successful and memorable.
