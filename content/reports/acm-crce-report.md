The ACM Chapter of Fr. CRCE is known for organizing and conducting successful workshops and seminars related to Information Technology; it has greatly contributed to increasing knowledge of students and keeping them updated about new technologies in the market. The first event of ACM for the year 2019-2020 was the 'Resume Building Workshop' for students from TE, where 69 students attended the session. The speaker was Mr. Sojan Chandy, the chairperson of the ACM council. Next, we organized a workshop on 'GitHub' as we knew how important it is to understand the necessary steps required to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub and in completing group projects.

In Synergy'19, ACM had organized an all-time favourite gaming event, PUBG tournament for all college students. The total number of participants in the event was 62, which included 36 for squads and 26 for duos. Gaming fanatics enjoyed the event and participated with enthusiasm. A cash prize of Rs. 2000 was given to the winner of Squad matches and Rs. 1000 was given to the winners of Duo matches.

Later in the year, a 'Software Design Workshop' was conducted by ACM in collaboration with IIT-B. It was taken by three professional members, namely Mr. Prajish Prasad, Senior PhD student at IIT-B, Mr. Bhupendar Singh, final year student pursuing BE IT and Ms Kinnari Gattare, a research assistant at IIT-B. The students were briefed about the software designing techniques and its advantages.

The year 2020 started with the 'Smart India Hackathon' (Internal college level). The judges judged the student teams on various factors such as presentation skills, idea solving, critical thinking and many such factors. After critical evaluation of all the teams by esteemed judges, the result was announced by Dr. Nilesh Patil (SPOC). A Case Study session was organized on 24th January 2020, for the students of class TE IT. The session was conducted by Mr. Sojan Chandy, the Chairperson of ACM council and was attended by 38 students. ‘SemiCode’ is an intercollege competitive coding competition similar to ACM-ICPC held across Mumbai every year. This year ACM-Fr.CRCE also joined hands with other ACM councils across Mumbai, namely ACM-MPSTME, ACM-SNDT, ACM-DBIT, ACM-Saboo Siddik and ACM-Vidyalankar. This competition helped students grasp the wider picture of a coding competition and know where they stand. We thank our faculty in-charge Prof. Prajakta Dhamanskar, our mentor Prof. Garima Tripathi and all the teaching and non-teaching staff for their endless support and encouragement. We would also like to thank the students for their participation and honest feedback. Last but not least, we appreciate the FragMag team for giving us this opportunity to share our achievements with everyone.
