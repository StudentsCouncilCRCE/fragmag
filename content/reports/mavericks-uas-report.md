MavericksUAS was established to push the envelope of technological prowess. It is testimony to what a couple of engineering students can achieve with nothing much but a will to achieve success in fields which are beyond the scope of the engineering curriculum. We strive to innovate in the areas of unmanned flight systems and automation. We validate our efforts by participating in competitions which test our capabilities.

MavericksUAS is a technical team which works in the fields of aerial and ground-based drones. We are particularly skilled in the development of autonomous unmanned multirotor flight systems. We have also developed a Vertical take-Off and Landing plane, which is a fusion of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Such innovation is only possible due to our endeavour to be on the bleeding edge of technology and research. We have also developed Quadcopters and Hexacopters which are capable of autonomous take-off, landing, flight, obstacle avoidance and package delivery. The projects we develop have unlimited potential in the avenues of search and rescue, disaster management, geographic mapping, etc.

During this year we participated in the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) competition, which has been conducted since 2003 each year. It was held from the 12th to the 15th June 2019 in Maryland, USA. The competition's problem statement states that an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) must deliver a package to a customer. The UAS must avoid obstacles like buildings, identify potential drop locations, drop the package to a safe place and then move the package to the customer's location. In our very first year of attempting this competition with our limited resources, we succeeded in attaining a rank of 43rd overall out of the 75 teams which participated from universities all across the world. The breakdown of the overall rank is as follows: Mission Rank - 31, Flight Readiness Review Rank - 41 and Journal Rank - 34. We also won the Just Joe Sportsmanship Reward for demonstrating a helpful nature towards the other participating teams.

In addition to this, we also believe in imparting knowledge to our fellow students. The team hence plans on conducting workshops on cutting edge topics as we have in the past years. To wrap up we would like to show our gratitude to Rev. Fr. Valerian Dâ€™Souza and our principal Dr Srija Unnikrishnan for their constant support which enables us to succeed in our endeavours. We would especially like to thank our mentor Dr Sunil Surve and Mr Ajay Koli, for guiding us and helping us in our journey which was full of trials and tribulations. We hope to assist our college in fulfilling the goal of moulding engineers who build the nation.
