Codelabs CRCE is a council powered by the well-known global organization HackerEarth. It aims at promoting the interdisciplinary nature of coding amongst students, irrespective of their fields. It organizes various technical and non-technical events for the same on an intra-college level. The council has provided students with multiple courses, free of cost, which would help them in their skills. Following are the events that were organized by the council:

**Alogoholic 1.0:<br>**
It is a coding competition that is held online so that students can take part in the comforts of their houses and compete with various students, for exposure. Many students participated in this event, and there was a lot of enthusiasm among them for the results. This event saw participation from all branches.

**Machine Learning Workshop:<br>**
The council conducted this workshop for Second Year students. An introduction to the Python language and in-depth knowledge on Machine Learning was the focus of the workshop. Students from all branches attended this workshop. We received excellent feedback from the students about this workshop.

**Python and Introduction to Machine Learning:<br>**
This workshop was organized for the students from the First Year of engineering from all branches. Students were taught the basics right from scratch, and the main plan was to give a brief introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Students attended this workshop enthusiastically, and a great response was received.

Other than these events, Codelabs CRCE along with Mozilla Campus CRCE organized a State Level Hackathon, “UNSCRIPT 2019”. Students across the state participated in this event. This event boosted the skills of coders and improved their programming skills. All the events throughout the year were organized successfully due to the hardworking members from the Codelabs council. Our main aim is to help several other students in their careers and raise the bars of programming in our college, and we will continuously try our level best to achieve this.
