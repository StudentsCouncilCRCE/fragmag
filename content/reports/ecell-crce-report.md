> Entrepreneur is someone who has a vision for something and a desire to create.”

The Entrepreneurship Cell of Fr. CRCE has a similar vision of transforming engineers or helping them find the entrepreneur in them. Life is too short to work for someone else's dream. At E-CELL, we aim to create and mould a way to show future engineers how entrepreneurship is the path to their goals. In the previous years, we have held numerous activities like courses, workshops, seminars by inviting industry professionals to help students build their vision towards success. This year, we kick-started with the ‘Financial Awareness’ event, which was held on 26th August 2019. The speaker of the event was Mr. Amit Chawla. He spoke about various insurance policies and financial management. On 21st September 2019, we organized a field visit to MICA labs. The students came to know about multiple controllers like PLC, SCADA that are used for manufacturing processes in the industries. It was a good experience, and on receiving a positive response, we thought of having many such events. On 3rd October 2019, E-CELL and IIC-CRCE together held a session on 'Product Design' where we invited an exceptional speaker, an ex-professor of our college Dr Y. D. Venkatesh. The session was very informative and highly appreciated by the students who attended the same.

On 17th January 2020, the E-CELL organized a seminar on proposal writing. The speakers of the session were Prof.Vaibhav Godbole and Prof. Kranti Wagle. The session consisted of a briefing on the Idea Competition and its various levels. On 30th January 2020, the E-CELL conducted 'The Idea competition' for students to explore their interests and develop something unique that would benefit the common man. This year's event saw the participation of 17 teams from various colleges in the city. The panel of judges consisted of Mr Mustafa Fatakdawala, Data Scientist who is also an Associate Consultant from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Prof. Dileep Chandra, IIC Convener at Fr.CRCE. Prof. Hitendra Vaishnav, Startup Co-ordinator IIC at FR.CRCE. All teams pitched innovative ideas, and every team had a Wow factor in them. The team with maximum points was declared as the winner of the competition.

We wouldn't have been able to achieve this level of success without the continuous support of our faculty in-charges: Prof. Prachi Patil and Prof. Prajakta Bhangale. We look forward to new opportunities keeping in mind the spirit of entrepreneurship.
