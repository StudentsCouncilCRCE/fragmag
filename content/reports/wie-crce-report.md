WIE-CRCE is an affinity group of IEEE also known as IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) which is the world’s leading professional organization dedicated to promoting women engineers and scientists, and inspiring girls to follow their academic interests in a career in engineering. The mission of WIE is to inspire, engage, encourage, and empower IEEE women worldwide. WIE-CRCE aims to teach the importance and advancements related to technology and social issues to women to make them whole as an individual with a firm technical background for the benefit of humanity. Helping students adapt to technological aspects of the modern world and being in power with any other professional is our objective.

With the council formation in the month of July 2019, WIE (Women in Engineering) Council was formed under the leadership of Prof. Sushma Nagdeote, the Branch Counselor of WIE. The Council members are Swaroop Raste as the Chairperson, Jagruti Bhanushali as the Vice-Chairperson, Yash Kumar as the Technical Head, Komal Shinde as the Marketing Head and Sheetal Sharma as the Second Year Representative. With this newly formed council, organizing various events were of paramount importance.

The first event organized by WIE was Paparazzi during the Tech-Fest of our college ‘SYNERGY’, in this event the students were expected to describe and sell product behind a curtain so that the audience cannot know what they are selling, the audience is made to think about the product by the description given by the contestant who is standing behind the curtain. The Second event of WIE was the Field Visit to MICA Labs, which was organized by WIE in association with IIC-Fr.CRCE. This field visit was attended by the faculty members of our college and students from other departments. This visit was organized for the students so that they get an insight into various Automation and Control Systems associated with the Marine Industrial Sector.

The Third Event was the Industrial Visit 2019 where the students of Electronics, Production, Computer and Information Technology of Second, Third and Fourth Year had gone to Shimla-Manali, where they saw the industries related to their field and had gained knowledge about how the industry works. The Fourth event was called SPARKS where students from class 8th to 10th of Fr Agnel Ashram where briefed on General Science concepts like Electromagnetism and Reflection of light in water with practical demonstration, after the session the students looked very much enlightened and interested and were very excited to have more of these sessions. The Fifth event was CodeBreakers which was conducted by WIE in coordination with IIC-Fr.CRCE, where the participants were given MCQs on Programming languages like C or Java and were made to solve them in a given time. The participants were mostly of Computer and IT Departments
