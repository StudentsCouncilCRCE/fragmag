Team Vaayushastra is a premier Aero Design and Modelling team that has practical experience in the design and fabrication of Fixed Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Team Vaayushastra was formed in 2012 to represent Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering in SAE Aero Design Competitions. The team is composed entirely of college undergraduates with aptitude and interests helpful for the challenge. The members of the team are recruited through a progression of interviews and aptitude tests to check their technical calibre and ability to co-operate as a team. The team then proceeds to conceptualize, design and fabricate different aspects of UAVs to contend in American skies.

The SAE Aero Design competition is intended to provide undergraduate and graduate engineering students with a genuine engineering challenge. The competition has been designed to provide exposure to the kinds of situations that engineers face in their real-life work environment. Since its initiation, the team has taken part in the advanced class of the competitions six times, continually enhancing its results. The theme for the advanced class spins around a subscale demonstration to colonize the surface of Mars. This necessitates the team to design a lot of reliable frameworks meeting standard pre-requisites of the class, including a Primary Aircraft, an Autonomous Glider and a Ground Station. The Autonomous Glider known as the Colonist Delivery Aircraft is released from the Primary Aircraft and houses humans that are represented by table tennis balls. Water Bottles and Habitat modules should likewise be released in the same flight, into the assigned landing zone, to sustain the humans on Mars and increase their days of habitability. All of this is ensured and executed using various sensors encompassing our Data Acquisition System coupled with a Graphical User Interface that predicts the trajectory of payloads, an Autonomous Control System that controls our CDA and parachutes to convey water bottles.

Well known for our amazing designs, ingenious avionics systems and having a stellar record, the team has earned quite a reputation in the international circuit. Last year the team stood 5th in the Technical Presentation and 9th place globally. This year at Lakeland, Florida we are proud to have stood 2nd in Asia and 9th among international teams with recognition from both the judging panel as well as our peers. In spite of the fact that we're uncertain about the status of the competition next year due to the pandemic, we promise to work sincerely and continue improving to make our college and country proud in the future. So watch us, join us and support us as we Dream, Build and Fly.
