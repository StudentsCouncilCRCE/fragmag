The council was formed on 1st November 2017 and has since been active. The teachers in charge of the council activities are Prof. S.K.Das and Prof. M.V.B.Rao, who have been a powerful driving force for the IIIExCRCE council. The IIIExCRCE had a great feat in the year 2019-20. This accomplishment has been possible because of the determination, aspiration and a belief to work towards something that helps the students and the community as a whole by all the team members. The council organised various successful events throughout the year.

‘Techno-talks’ and ‘paper planes’ were the two events organised in the ‘CRESCENDO 2019’ technical fest and were acknowledged in enormous numbers.

The council had a great start to 2020 by organizing an industrial visit on 28th, 29th, 30th January at Central Railway workshop, Matunga. For innovation day, the council came up with an equally innovative idea 'Best Design Creator' and reached out to maximum students so that they were able to showcase their innovative skills. A certificate of appreciation in recognition of an 'outstanding innovative activity' on innovation day (30th January 2020) was awarded to the IIIExCRCE council (secured 3rd prize).

Because of these activities, the council members, as well as the participants, were able to prove their capabilities with innate capacities. These events served as an excellent example for the team spirit displayed by the IIIEx CRCE council. Altogether the year 2019-20, emerged to be victorious. The council would strive to work hard and organise many more successful activities to involve the students to have an all-round development.
