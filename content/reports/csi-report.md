Computer Society of India (CSI), CRCE is a council that works at its best for the students to have an all-round development by taking part in the numerous activities planned all around the year while simultaneously keeping up with the trends as per industry standards. The council plans fun and interactive events throughout the year for its members to ensure that the First and SecondYear students are provided with a firm footing in the technical domain.

The council began the academic year by organizing the first non-technical event during our college fest Synergy, LAN Gaming (Counter-Strike 1.6), a multiplayer game that is played in the gaming battle zone. The tournament went on for a day with the participants battling it out till the ultimate showdown. A survey was conducted to understand the needs of all the members. Based on the results of the study, everal activities were held throughout the year. One common area of interest was chosen and based on that a workshop on ReactJS was conducted. It was a hands-on workshop led by Khalid Shaikh, the technical secretary of the council. The event enlightened the students about React, a frontend JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces.

Furthermore, CSI, in collaboration with the other councils namely, ACM, IEEE-WIE and SAE organized the Industrial Visit to Shimla, Manali and Chandigarh in December 2019. This semester, the council successfully hosted two events, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and Competitive Programming. The seminar on Intellectual Property Rights was conducted by Professor and Dean (Research and Development), Dr. Bhushan Patil. The purpose of this event was to host a seminar where students could be briefed on the importance and proper management of property rights through patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. The second event was an informative session on Competitive Programming hosted by the alumni of our college, Mr. Gaurav Sen and Mr. Khushan Sen. The course focused on guiding the students on how and when to begin competitive programming and the significant role it plays during placements.

A Poster Making Competition was conducted on Innovation Day in collaboration with the IIC. The participants were asked to make posters which would stand out based on ideas, design, entrepreneurship and innovation. Thus the CSI council is always ready and open to every mind in the institution, thereby helping them become industry-ready. With a bunch of dedicated and talented members in the council, sincerest efforts are made to ensure that participants and target audiences are always at the forefront while planning an event.
