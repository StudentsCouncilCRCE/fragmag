ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) CRCE is a studentâ€™s chapter that enables collaboration, knowledge sharing, career enrichment and skills development across all engineering disciplines. ASME council organizes several events around the year. During Crescendo 2019, ASME organized two events; SUSPENSION BRIDGE and TECHNICAL QUIZ UP.

TECHNICAL QUIZ-UP
The ASME chapter of CRCE held 'TECHNICAL QUIZ-UP' as one of its special events for the Technical Fest 'CRESCENDO 2019'. The event had several registrations and was a big hit. The event included the testing of time and knowledge of the participant's subject of interest. With a vast horizon of topics from Android, Computer Networking, Strength of Materials, etc., the participants had a great time quizzing their minds on their topics of interest.

SUSPENSION BRIDGE
The second event during the Technical Fest 'CRESCENDO 2019' was Suspension bridge. Teams from various classes competed to construct a suspended bridge out of the materials given by the council. The materials provided were popsicle sticks, thread and glue bottles. The game aimed to create a suspended bridge that could sustain maximum weight. The event was a success as many teams registered for the event and showed their distinct talent.

The event aimed at sharpening the technical side of the budding engineers by constructing a prototype of a suspended bridge using all their mechanical knowledge. With an endeavor to promote hands-on engineering among budding engineers, the event was one of its kinds. The council is thankful to the faculty advisors for their continuous support and encouragement.
