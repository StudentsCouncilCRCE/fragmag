During the preparation of college events like Euphoria, Athlos, Synergy or even during the days of exams and submissions, watching Agnelites run along the corridors in Fr. Crce is not a rare sight. But one room in the premises is left out of this chaos, be it a holiday or any other event day Lab no "709", the ROBOCON Lab is always seen buckling down, tinkering with the tools. We are driven by an acute zest for learning technological advancements and happenings in the modern world and endeavour in applying theoretical learning in realistic projects.

Robocon CRCE, initiated back in 2013 intending to participate in Asiaâ€™s largest competition-ABU Robocon, we have since diversified into various other competitions and research avenues. We are a group of robotics enthusiasts from diverse engineering backgrounds who constantly strive to solve relevant, real-world problems using artificial intelligence and robotics mechanisms. With each competition that we take part in, we try to bring in something new to the world of robotics. Our team comprises of Computer, Electronics and Production subsystems which work in tandem to build working, usable bots.

Currently, our team is focusing on participating in the Robocon 2020 Suva, Fiji competition. The ABU Robocon 2020 Suva contest is to play rugby 7â€™s game using two robots and five obstacles as five defending players. The highlight of this game is how the two robots collaborate to score Try and the Goal Kick. The main and unique challenge of this game will be Goal Kick, kicking the Kick Ball over the crossbar of the conversion post because of the unique shape of the rugby ball. Building a robot that can meet all the challenges sioned in the problem statement requires prolonged thinking, testing of many mechanisms, skilful programming and constant efforts.

Additionally we are happy to state that our unlimited undertakings and gigantic hard work have begun paying off. We have effectively cleared the stage 1 of the competition with AIR - 11. Furthermore, we are giving our best to make it for the further stages!Apart from this, We hold regular workshops of basic robotics to help and teach robotics enthusiasts. We intend to help students who are interested in robotics and related fields but lack the required knowledge to build the robot. Now, as the competition draws, closer our team is going the extra mile to make the BOTs more efficient to compete for the Winner's title at Robocon 2020 Suva, Fiji.

Lastly, we would like to thank Rev. Fr. Valerian D'Souza, our principal Dr.Srija Unnikrishnan and Dr.Deepak Bhoir for their constant support behind the achievements we have made so far. We also would especially thank our mentor Ms Kranti Wagle and Mr.Saurabh Korgaonkar for guiding us and helping us overcome every difficulty that we encountered along our journey so far. Finally, we hope to bring pride and prestige to our college and rightly live up to its vision : "Moulding Engineers who can build the nation."
