SME (Society of Manufacturing Engineers) is a group of students and faculty who share a collaborative vision of an inspired, educated and prosperous manufacturing community. At the SME council, our aim, objective and mission are to try our best to promote manufacturing technology and develop the skills of our members, to advance manufacturing and attract future generations.

The council actively takes part in all the activities & festivals in the college like the technical festival CRESCENDO that was held in March 2019. The council has been preparing to give all the visitors a taste of Industrial Technology and fun by conducting one technical event and one non-technical event during Crescendo.

The first one was our flagship event, i.e. CAD WARS. This event challenged the participants on how good they are with software such as AUTOCAD, NX, and SOLIDWORKS. For this event, the participants were given a problem statement. This problem statement was in terms of drawing, and they had to execute the same with the help of the softwares. Several students, including the ones from the First Years, participated in the event. The second non-technical event was called Tech Pong. It was a charade game in which players throw a ping pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup with a chit on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side. The event was very successful, with a huge turnout of participants.

The SME council is thankful to Prof. D. S. S. Sudhakar for encouraging and guiding us in all the activities performed by the SME council. All in all, with a very successful year, we intend to develop even more and continue to have a positive impact on the manufacturing engineering community.
