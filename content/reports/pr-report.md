When the year started, I was told by one of my seniors that my job would never go the way it has to. I will always have last-minute glitches, participants and teams backing out at the last minute and yet, I had to keep the show going.

Keeping these things in mind, I began my year as the Public Relations Head. I was given an overview of how my year would look like. The year started with the Induction Ceremony of the Students' Council, followed by Yoga Day 2019. Synergy, a fundraising event for all Councils, Clubs, and Teams was held in August 2019, followed by Friendship day 2019 which saw all the classesâ€™ battle out for points. The most prestigious Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate took place on 27th and 28th September which witnessed 32 colleges from all over India. With this, all the events for our odd semester ended with huge success!

The even semester kick-started with the Alumni meet which saw an overwhelming participation this year. Our Inter-collegiate sports festival, Athlos 2020, was next on the list. This festival saw several sports events organized at different venues and witnessed colleges from all across Mumbai displaying their sportsmanship. Euphoria 2020, our annual cultural festival was held from 17th to 20th February 2020 and saw intra and inter-college events. Paridhan, our inter-college dance competition, and Junoon, our inter-college band competition witnessed colleges from all over Mumbai battle it out for the grand prize. The efforts put in by the council, and the FE volunteers were commendable and highly appreciated by the students as well as the faculty.

I find it very necessary to mention the fact of how great of an opportunity it is to be a part of the Students' Council of our college. The small things that fell under my duties, like circulating an important message to the class representatives, to resolving issues between the students, to taking calls and resolving the queries of external students. The days and nights invested in meeting the requirements of planning a festival. From the micro to macro planning of a fest developed a sense of responsibility in me. It taught me how to make quick, wise decisions, build my confidence and improve my patience. All of this would not have been possible without the guidance and support shown by our mentor and the dean of Students' Affairs, Dr. Bhoir, the confidence shown by our principal, Dr.Srija Unnikrishnan and the co-operation shown by all faculty members that stood as pillars for us throughout the year.

I am extremely thankful to all the faculty members that have shown faith in me and given me this fantastic opportunity that taught me things that no syllabus could and left me with so many unforgettable memories.
