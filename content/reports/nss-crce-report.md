The year commenced with the registration of 100 active volunteers across SE, TE and BE and kick-starting our array of activities; we began with a Tree Plantation Drive followed by an awareness program conducted by the Bisleri Association to put bottles into good use. Next were the Beach Cleanup programs at Chimbai in association with the NGO 'United Way'. In 2019, floods hit many parts of Maharashtra, and one of the most affected cities was Kolhapur. We organized a Donation Drive for flood relief which received an excellent response from the Staff and Students. It was followed by a Blood Donation drive where we witnessed active participation of our fellow Students and Staff members.

As the month of festivities commenced, Post Ganpati Visarjan beach cleanups were organized at Juhu and various other Beaches from 4th to the 13th of September which was a massive success. That was followed by a week-long Bandra fair volunteering cum crowd management where our members assisted the Mumbai Police. There were bouquet of events lined up like Plastic Ban Rally, an awareness seminar to throw light on child abuse, volunteering at the Read Carnival by United Way where the marginalized children were given an opportunity of reading to their heart’s content, Walk for Freedom rally to stand against the inhumane practice of human trafficking, Beach cleanup in collaboration with Coco-Cola, disaster management workshop organized by Mumbai university and also a gender equality session arranged by Akshara Rao NGO.

This year NSS took a great initiative by planting fruit-bearing trees around the College Campus whose entire produce would go to the organization. The most exciting part was an 8-day camp to the Tandulwadi area of Palghar District. The aim was to educate the kids about various technologies and help them to get familiar with the basic and advanced technological advancement. The members engrossed themselves in painting the school walls bright, exploring the rural life, trekking up a hill and interacting with the villagers

On commencement of the Even Semester, A Nature Trail to Sanjay Gandhi National Park was organized which gave a fresh start to the year. Next a Blood Donation Drive was organized, which received a massive response again. We extend our gratitude to our Program Officers Prof. Saurabh Korgaonkar, Prof. Dipali Bhise and Prof. Pradeep Singh for their valuable inputs which proved beneficial to our volunteers through thick and thin of each event. As a team, we always prioritize ‘You’ before ‘Me’ spreading cheer and smiles around. We sincerely thank our Director, our Principal and ‘YOU’ for appreciating the work we do. Happy serving!
