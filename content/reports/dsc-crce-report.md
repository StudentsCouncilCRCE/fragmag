About DSC CRCE

Clubs, Fr. CRCE Chapter stands in a uniquely arisen situation where Project Based Learning for the
enhancement of required Industrial Knowledge for an individual to succeed in the rat race of Social
Achievements, is not only Desired but also considered necessary in todayâ€™s world and age.

of equipping Students from the very foundation of their careers with resources to match the high

support of Google Developer looks forward to inculcating the Growth of Tech Based Learning in the
fresh minds of the core foundation of this college by organizing highly effective Workshops and
Study Jams. Furthermore, Developer Student Clubs will be mentoring students inclined towards

Events:

1. VR Maze Runner (Synergy)
   As our first kickstart event, we organized a technical fun event at college fest (Synergy). A
   game called &quot;Maze Chaser&quot; but in a more digital world. And when we say digital, we mean
   Virtual Reality. So a game designed from scratch called VR Maze Runner.
   We overall entertained 100 different attendees. And they gave us nice feedback!
2. GCP Crash Course
   Our second event, which helped us increase our engagement in different colleges. As
   mentioned above, Developer Student Clubs, is Powered by Google Developers. Hence, the
   biggest product of Google Developers - Google Cloud Platform. Google Cloud runs on
   Google Cloud Platform. Almost all the companies in today&#39;s date have moved on Cloud. Now
   with abundant Cloud Services available in the market, it&#39;s essential for the students to not only
   just learn about Cloud Computing, but also get some hands-on experience on a Cloud
   Platform and to explore it&#39;s different services other than Compute. So we came up with a
   unique event wherein we gave our attendees free Training on Google Cloud Platform for a
   month on majorly three main tracks.

   - Application Development
   - Machine Learning
   - Data
     Each Track consisted of mainly 5 Quests. Each Quests was made available on Qwiklabs - A
     platform to learn and get hands-on experience on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon
     Web Services (AWS). The attendees were given the liberty to choose more than 1 track. And
     as a validation they were awarded with a digital badge after completing one single quest,
     which resembles how well the learner knows the particular quest. As a token of appreciation
     the attendee who completes at least one track, was given some sort of goodie from Google
     Cloud as a giveaway.

3. Firebase Workshop Seminar
   Our final event was in collaboration with Google Developer Groups - Mumbai Application
   Developer (GDG MAD). This Firebase Workshop Seminar was organized with a set of view
   keeping in mind
   - To show the attendees - power of Application Development
   - To teach them the flow on how to build a Mobile Application from scratch
   - To connect the attendees with latest Google Product for App Development
   - To teach the attendees on How-to &quot;make cross platform native Mobile Application&quot;
     This was a 2 day interactive session for 6 hours each day. At the end of the day attendees
     came out with their own Mobile App (Chat App). This gave the attendees a wing to fly
     towards the trending technology of the world - Android &amp; iOS Mobile Application
     Development.

Staff &amp; College Co-operation:

As said that a country is nothing without a president, a Prime Minister and cabinet of ministers. A
child is nothing without his/her parents. Similarly a student is nothing without his/her teacher(s). As
our council established in July 2019. And our first event was held in August 2019. So it was quite a
rush for us to handle the load between academics, community building, resume building, and
conducting events. But our visionary was our Teacher In-charge, Prof. Merly Thomas. She directed us
at every path. She gave us a map to follow our quest to build a community. She was the best
connection between us (the students) and the higher authority Professors. We would also like to thank
our respected Dean of Student Affairs (Dr. Prof. Deepak .V. Bhoir) and Dean of Academics (Dr. Prof.
Sunil Surve), who granted us permission to hold such productive events. We would also like to thank
our respected Training Placement Officer (Prof. Sharma), who believed in our system of bridging the
gap between theory and practical. We would also like to thank our respected Principal Dr. Srija
Unnikrishnan and Hon&#39;ble Father Valerian D&#39;Souza who guided us along the way in our journey for
Project Based Learning. We would like to thank all the working and non-working staff, without whom
none of our event would&#39;ve been possible. Thanks a million times, to all!
