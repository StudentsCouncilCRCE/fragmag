Team CRCE Formula Racing is a formula student team of 35 students from Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, Bandra which builds a Formula Student (FS) race car and participates in various Formula Student events held across India.

Team CFR started with the design phase of its latest Formula Student car, 'GODSPEED 2.0' in March 2019, followed by the manufacturing phase in July and the testing phase in December 2019. All parts of the car are designed, procured and manufactured by the team members itself. The team is expected to stick to a strict schedule throughout the making of their vehicle, the schedule for which is laid down by the competition officials. With about 90 participating teams, Time is a crucial element at the competition; and once again this year the team was prompt in following this schedule due to which the team was upgraded to a 'Tier 1' team. A 'tier 1' team over a 'tier 2' team benefits considerably by getting preference in any event queue.

The team participated in Formula Bharat 2020 held in January at the Kari Motor Speedway, Coimbatore. The car was judged on the engineering practices that were followed during its making and the cost and design considerations. There were a series of static and dynamic events and on that basis, points were given, and the overall rank of the team was decided. Team CRCE Formula Racing secured 25th overall on a national front amongst 90 participating teams. This project was a success because of the support of its sponsors and well-wishers.
There is a lot of scope for improvement and broad fields to excel for the Team CFR looks forward to performing it's best at the upcoming National and International Competitions. The team has the vision to switch to an electric vehicle in the next two years and take a leap forward towards a greener future.

New Projects bring new challenges which ultimately bring new responsibilities. We look forward to receiving support from all the students of Fr. CRCE.
