> “Technology works best when it brings people together.”<br>social distancing, please.

On 31st August 2019, the first major tech event, “Synergy Hackathon” was held. Hackathon’s give Student developers an opportunity to come together, work collaboratively, tackle problems, and compete for fame and glory. The primary goal of this event was to raise awareness of technical talent and foster a competitive, yet cooperative, and congenial culture for talented individuals. It also allowed participants to connect with Industry personnel’s, faculty mentors, and most importantly, with each other.

Problem statements ranged from an app (chatbot for college and parents interaction, healthcare for patients) to aid Machine learning to solve real life problems like skin disease detection, fake news prediction, and food classification for a healthy diet. Judges scored solutions’ creativity, technical depth, challenge of doing the task in a short amount of time, and usefulness in the real world.

With 32 teams participating, we saw incredible competition amongst students to win the coveted prizes and everyone went home with a steep uphill climb on a rigorous learning curve.

Commencement of the even semester saw the college invite applications for the much anticipated Smart India Hackathon shortlisting process. This internal hackathon aimed to motivate teams to work on the prototype of their solutions for problem statements picked off the SIH website. The hackathon concluded with top 5 teams post judging rounds that got through to the next selection rounds for SIH 2020.

The climax of the academic year was all set to take place with the Technical Festival, Crescendo 2020. With the hit events from previous years, and new additions this year, Crescendo was going to be a grand affair where the strongest technical minds from all over the city come and compete for the much sought after Crescendo Best Technical Class Trophy and Best Contingent Trophy.

Right from Hack-athon, to Mech-athon, to Hog-athon, this year, Crescendo had it all. Keeping up with the times, this edition also saw the release of the Crescendo application with an integrated payment gateway to support all online/UPI payments making the event, registration, participation and point calculation a completely cashless and automated affair. A referral system put in place this year also aimed to boost participation amongst students.

Crescendo this year, like always, was to live up to its name and draw curtains to the year at the epitome of affairs.

Update: Crescendo 2020 was rescinded to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

Absolutely gutted to see our technical fest not getting executed. The Council and Crescendo Team had worked really hard to put everything in order. Nevertheless, I see my juniors fervently learning and implementing technologies, that is my marker for knowing we are headed in the right direction. That’s my cue to hand over the baton.
