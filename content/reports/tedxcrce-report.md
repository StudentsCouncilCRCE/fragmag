TEDxCRCE believes that many new ideas find resemblances with similar concepts working well for different areas in the circle of development. On the 7th of October 2019, TEDxCRCE hosted its ‘Salon Event’ in the college. Speakers from diverse backgrounds came under one roof and spoke on ideas that hold the potential of bringing about a significant change, sharing the stage with a single mission of “Ideas Worth Spreading". The admirable personalities were Mr Jigar Rajpopat (self-taught drummer/percussionist),Mr Vinod More (speed artist and painter), Mrs Suchitra Pillai (actress and an alumnus of our college) and Mrs Sujata Deshmukh (HR expert). The event also had a segment called "Give Your Own TEDx Talk" where students from our college shared their views on various topics and gained an experience of delivering a real TEDx talk. Anish Dias from BE IT ,Chyankk Kumar from TE Electronics and Pranay Bagrecha from TE Computers spoke about their journey.

On the 29th of February 2020, TEDxCRCE organized one of CRCE’s flagship events, the “Internship & Career Expo'' hosting multiple companies at our college campus. The expo was attended by students from all branches of our college. Due to a wonderful response received by our college students, we kept the event open to students from other colleges as well. Having seen a fantastic response from companies and an equally resounding feedback from the students over the years, The Internship & Career Expo had 15 companies offering summer internships from technical as well as non-technical domains including Marketing, Graphic Designing, Photography, Business Analyst, Content Writing, Web and App Development, PHP Backend, Cloud Computing, AI, ML, Data Science, Blockchain, Full Stack Development, Embedded Systems Development, Smart Systems and Manufacturing.

On the 4th of April 2020, TEDxCRCE is set to host its fifth version of TEDx Talks. Our theme for the event is "Shifting Gears". This year we at TEDxCRCE believe that we humans are programmed to grow stronger, faster, and smarter. Our ability to think, learn and grow bigger has always taken us to heights that we never dreamed of, as we know that great things never came from comfort zones. One needs to adapt continuously to new things and move forward in order to grow and reach his goal.

We as a community also had the opportunity to work with the Mumbai Roti Bank Organization and have volunteered to help them conduct various food donation drives. We had arranged a session at ‘The Welfare for Stray Dogs’ for passionate animal lovers to do their part towards the dog community. We also conducted two sessions with the children from the 'Father Agnel Ashram'.We want to express our sincere gratitude to our Director Rev. Fr. Valerian D’Souza, Principal Dr.Srija Unnikrishnan, the college management, our Teacher-in-charges Prof. Prachi Patil, Prof. Monali Shetty, our faculty members and the student community for their unstinted, consistent support and encouragement in all our endeavours. I would like to extend my gratitude to my council members who have worked very hard and continued to make TEDxCRCE strive for more every year. Going forward, we at TEDxCRCE will endeavour to achieve a fresh new outlook for our projects and will raise the bar further in creating more powerful, professional and energetic community-centric events.
