Society of Automobile Engineers(SAE) International is a global association of more than 128,000 engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive and commercial-vehicle industries. Their core competencies are life-long learning and voluntary consensus standards development. SAEINDIA is a strategic alliance partner of SAE International registered in India as an Indian non-profit engineering and scientific society dedicated to the advancement of the mobility industry in India.

SAE INDIA is India's leading resource for mobility technology and is an individual member-driven society of mobility practitioners, which includes Engineers, Executives from Industry, Government Officials, Academics and Students. Our college has its SAE INDIA collegiate club which was founded in the academic year 2012-2013. Fr.CRCE SAE chapter provides students with SAE membership at a nominal fee which gives them access to SAE's technical publications. We also conduct a lot of talks, events and industrial visits, some of which are listed below.

An Industrial Visit to Shimla, Manali and Chandigarh for students from second year onward was held from the 27th of December, 2019 to the 4th of January, 2020.

Another Industrial Visit took place on the 8th of February, 2020 for students of Third-year Production Engineering. During the visit, students visited Vimal Steel plant and Capital Impex Factory in Vasai. Around 60 students attended the same.

30th of January, 2020 was observed as the Innovation Day. The SAE chapter at Fr.CRCE organized their event - 'Innovatesy'. The tag of the event was 'COME AND GIVE YOUR PROBLEMS TO US'. For the event, the participants had to select one domain from a list of 10 domains from climate change to healthcare and public transport. After selecting the domain participants needed to note down a problem in the following field and explain it briefly. What seemed a very simple, easy and short task, turned out to be challenging, even before finding the solution to problems in the respective domains and defining them. By the end of the event we successfully stood 2nd overall.
