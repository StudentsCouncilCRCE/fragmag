> Fr.CRCE hosted its Flagship event on the 27-28th of September 2019. The 21st edition of the annual National level Conceicao Rodrigues Memorial Debate 2019 fondly called as CRMD.

> The theme for this year was
> Ideologies: Egocentrism Engendering Self Abatement.

CRMD is an Oxford-style debate competition. It is lauded by people who have witnessed it. Teams from across India eagerly wait to bag the Prestigious Trophy with their debating prowess. Like always this year too, we witnessed 32 teams battling for the Grand prize. Teams from Hyderabad, Goa, Pune & Mumbai, battled hard through the league rounds to secure their position in the quarter-finals.

Dr. Meeran Chadha Borwankar (Ex. IPS Officer) was the chief guest for the inaugural ceremony on the 27th of September. She enlightened the audience with her thought-provoking ideas. She delightedly shared her debating experiences with everyone. One such experience was when she won a debate competition with her partner who is now the Chief Election Commissioner of India.

Our Judges included experts from the field of Communication, Education, & from the corporate world. An Adjudicator plays a vital role. Their valuable feedback post the debate helps the teams to analyse their mistakes and the areas of improvement. Our adjudicators judiciously noted down all the points they thought the participating teams should consider before moving for the next round. The top 8 teams battled their way in quarters. Four teams proved their debating skills and secured a position in the semi-finals. Following was the panel for the semi-final round:Mr Ganesh Dalvi, an expert in operations training, Mrs Anu Malla, a consultant and corporate trainer, Mrs. Deepa Panakkal, an assistant professor for communication skills at the St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai.

The semi-final rounds saw the finest debates of this edition; however, in a debate, it's just the two teams having the strongest points & arguments that make it to the finals. After hours of meticulous planning on the motions, the following motion was selected for the Finale. “This House prefers a world where the conception of the afterlife is based on karmic balance, rather than divine mercy”

Mr Milind Wagle was the chief guest for the Finals of CRMD' 19. Mr Milind Wagle has been a commentator since 1975. He has been a commentator for five cricket world cups, 6 Olympic Games, 8 common-wealth and Asian games and 25 Olympic sports events.

Following were the Judges for the Finals of CRMD' 19:
Mr Jagjyot Singh, a name synonymous to Fr. CRCE is an Entrepreneur and a debater himself. He won the best speaker award from 2006-2009 in CRMD even bagging the prestigious CRMD trophy from 2006-2008. Mr Surajit Pal is a successful writer and a rank holder at the Pharma Asiamoney. Mrs Sakshi Chandraakar is the founder of Finesse, an image enhancement and skills enrichment academy.

Both teams gave a cut-throat competition. Side Opposition, Team CMD17 (Sardar Patel Institute of Technology) won the prestigious CRMD Trophy of 2019. Side Proposition, Team CMD32 (Mithibai College) were declared as the runners-up for CRMD'19. Mr Azain Jaffer received the best Speaker award, and Mr Purav Bharadwaj received the best Adjudicator award.

I want to extend my sincere gratitude to our Local Superior Rev.Fr. Peter D'Souza, Director Rev.Fr. Valerian D'Souza, Principal Dr Srija Unnikrishnan for all the love and support my team and I received pre and post the event.I cannot forget the pillars behind this year’s grand success starting from Prof Supriya Kamoji and Prof Garima Tripathi, whose leadership made this year’s edition the one to never forget! I would also like to thank, Dr Deepak Bhoir (Dean of Student Affairs) who made sure that the event is perfectly executed, to Prof Sundary Prabavathy, who helped us to conceptualize this year’s edition based on her vast experience from previous CRMD’s and to Prof. Khushbu Trehan, for brainstorming this year’s theme and for recommending some of the best personalities as our esteemed judges. Finally I would like to appreciate the entire Students’ Council for they were the ones who made sure the show runs without a single error. I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart.

Finally, a big thank you to all the helping hands, without them, CRMD would not have been possible. While I sign off, all I want to tell you is that CRMD 2019 will always be this one Special Event in my life. After all I had the best team one can ever ask for.
