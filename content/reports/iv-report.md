The much-awaited annual industrial visit of Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering, Mumbai took place with a centralized conglomerate of staff & students to Chandigarh, Shimla & Manali from the 27th December 2019 to 4th January 2020 with proposed industrial visit sites scheduled at Rajiv Gandhi Information Technology (IT) Park at Chandigarh, Micro Turners Group at Baddi, (Himachal Pradesh) & Jay Bee Transformers at Panchkula (Haryana). The industrial visit was organized by the technical councils of the college viz. IEEE-WIE, SAE, ACM & CSI who handled every detail. Right from the planning to execution. Leading the group were students Ricky Stanley of BE (Electronics Engineering), Akshay Dixit of TE (Production Engineering) & Sahil Gupta of TE (Computer Engineering). The complete arrangement of the tour was outsourced by the Students' council to Mr Nitish Parab of 'Around the Globe (ATG)' holidays who accompanied the group along with four of his associates.

A total of 145 students, mainly comprising second year, third year & final year engineering from all four branches viz. electronics, production, computer & information technology were accompanied by Dr. Brijmohan S. Daga (Professor & Head, Computer Engineering Department), Dr. Nilesh M. Patil (Assistant Professor, Information Technology), Prof. Unik B. Lokhande (Assistant Professor, Information Technology), Prof (Mrs.) Supriya S. Kamoji (Assistant Professor, Computer Engineering), Prof (Mrs.) Dipali Y. Koshti (Assistant Professor, Computer Engineering), Prof Jayen Modi (Assistant Professor, Electronics Engineering) and Mr. Yogesh Chavan (Non-teaching staff).

Usually, the underlying objective of any industrial visit is for students to gather a first-hand experience of how the professional working methodology, various industrial processes, machinery & other related equipment are in place so that once they enter into the professional field, after the completion of their respective courses, so these industrial tours are an effort to bridge this gap of practical exposure.

In view of these objectives, the following companies were visited during this industrial visit.

1. Visions Software Pvt. Ltd. (Chandigarh), a specialist in web design & development, customized standalone software development as well as Mobile Applications.
2. Auscan Academy of Information Technology (Chandigarh), one of the most reputed groups for technological education and research in Chandigarh. The company is into following services: Telecom Network Integration, Mechanical Engineering Solutions, Software Engineering Solutions, and Embedded & Automation Solutions.
3. Micro Turner Group, Baddi (Himachal Pradesh), one of the largest integrated automotive component manufacturers in India mainly involved in manufacturing of Transmission Gear Train Assembly, Kick Start Mechanism, Gear Shifting Towers & Forks, Sprockets, Ratchets, Pinions, Special Engine Fasteners, Different shafts, Bearing Races & Rings, Chassis Assembly, Fabricated Frames, Muffler Assembly, Swing Arms, Axles, Precision Ground Bushes and Special Turned Components.
4. Aar Kay Shawl Industries, Bhuntar â€“ Kullu (Himachal Pradesh), involved in traditional shawl making & other garments manufacturing using simple automated machines & processes.
