It all began with a Bat eating Brat!

Somewhere in a Chinese Street;

It just progressed like a rapid fire;

With our ‘Amore Italiana’ in the lead.<br><br>

Tested Positive, Lives lost;

People mourning, Throughout Gloom;

Families unyoked; many hearts broken;

But never lost Hope, ‘We’ll meet soon’!

Perhaps a different scenario in our dear Nation;

From Dalgona to Money Heist we advanced;

From burning cakes until coal to Zoom mishaps,

Not to forget the Clapping of hands and the Banging of pots;

Our Country did see it all!<br><br>

Next came in a Benediction for the ‘Student Race’;

The calling off of what they call, ‘Exams’!

Our joy there knew no bounds,

Should’ve seen the drooped faces of our Sirs and Mams!<br><br>

Above all, this Period taught us Virtues galore;

A break from the daily Uproar, A much needed bond between our families;

But deep down in our hearts we all know;

It’s the ‘CRCE’ that we truly dearly miss!<br><br>
