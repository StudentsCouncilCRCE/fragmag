To talk about my time during this lockdown I'd start off by saying I felt I was under lockdown only for the 7 days i had spent in Bombay, sitting all alone in my flat with nothing to do. I knew then, that I'd have some fun if I got on the last flight to Goa, which I did. I finally got back to my Hometown; So now it's the 21st of March and Its touchdown at Goa and then came 14 long days of quarantine, 14 days of bad Internet service in Goa. So Stuck in my room, thinking about Day 15 in Goa. Expecting things to get back to the 'Chill Out (Susegad)' Days we normally had, I found myself deep into this lockdown trap. That "Susegad" life wasn't coming soon. While I waited for the ~_Vibe_~ in Goa to get to Normalcy, I shifted track to help out in essential services, my Dad's business, farming.... and It's helped me think about the simpler things in Life. Life ain't always about partying and going crazy but you gotta make most with what's in front of you. It's time to Rewind and take a good long look at what we've done in life. This lockdown has thought me that it's the simple things in life that matter the most. So let's enjoy this lockdown rather than showing a grin to it. Cheers and have a good one.
