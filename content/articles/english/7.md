All he had with him was a beautiful dream,

It was not as easy as it seemed,

Yet he kept marching towards his goal,

And worked very hard with his heart and soul,

The world tried to bring him down,

Every effort was thrashed to the ground,

Nevertheless, he was a fighter, he wanted to fly,

He succeeded in reaching beyond the sky.
