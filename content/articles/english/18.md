Silence has stretched arms

In the warzones of grief,

Blood streaming from armours

Speaks legends in brief

O solitude! Where is your charm?

Those sages had on face,

Have you been choked or harassed?

What none wants to face

Just listen to those loud cries

From the fights of MINE,

Some crying out from hunger

Some for royal sparkling wine

O peace! Where is your calmness?

That saints had acquired,

Was it not you giving the noble, Nobles?

Making the world admirable

Women with wrinkles wait

For calls from their son,

So do the lovely wives.

Those dead on borders, with gun

O promise! Where is your trust?

Those lovers do keep boasting of,

Seems as if you are the root of heartache,

None keep you to boast of.

In meadows the banyan sobs,

It misses hide and seek

Of the kids in orangey evenings

Hearing their innocent squeaks

O childhood! Where is your beauty?

That all remember till death,

You seem so loaded with techno

Yet helpless in your last breath
