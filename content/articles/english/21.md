How can you not appreciate sadness?

When you feel sad and done with your life,

And tears roll down from your delicate eyes,

You must realize that you're able to cry!

You are a being that can express sadness,

By weeping from exactly those organs,

That helps you perceive this beautiful world,

That when you are wrecked and your life is stirred,

Crying makes you feel lighter and better,

I see hope right there, and I shall be hopeful forever.
