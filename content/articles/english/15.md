All that seeks glory is not only yours truly

All that seeks glory could not be yours truly,

When you have the glory is it only yours truly

Efforts put in frugally? Do you seek it truly?

Relict to be an epitome? It took 1000 years to build Rome,

And that’s the zeal which none shall steal

Fighting till the triumph, all that time and glory doesn’t toss a dime

Concur and it’s a blunder or conquers till six feet under

All that seeks glory is now all yours truly.
