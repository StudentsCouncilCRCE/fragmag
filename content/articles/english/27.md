Strangely, and confused

Are my tensions,

Revolving like the infinite,

Barely do I have, as the paths get longer and still

I speak with my heart and soul.

O! Lord! Lead us to enlightenment, O!

I delight in the evolutions and all your creations,

Give me the peace feel, I know all around is just an illusion,

You made us connected with stories and thoughts, with ups and falls,

Lifecycle is just as long as itâ€™s short enough, though..

Keep us alive with spirits higher,

I speak with my heart and soul

O! Lord! Lead us to enlightenment, O!
