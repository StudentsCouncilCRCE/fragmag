The wind and the trees are talking today,

About how lonely the roads feel.

It reminds them of the time when

These roads didn’t exist-

A time when humans weren’t supreme

A time when nature was natural

But today isn’t any different

From how 10000 years ago was,

For humans are sheltered back in their caves

Fearing the nature

And the retaliation it brings.

These roads aren’t lonely, however

Sharing its solitude with the birds and the dogs

The only one feeling truly lonely

Are the humans, watching them go out.
