My dad always shouted at me saying,“You know what you are studying in college; you should get your grades up!”

The line 'you know what you are studying' is the key to everything in your life. It's right in front of you. Now, maybe your dad believes that his child is capable of handling his/her own problems in life, or maybe your dad doesn't believe in that, but you need to. Someone else is already giving you a chance by saying 'you know what you are doing'.

That's what you want right? Freedom!
