“That’s it”, cried Nature, with a sigh,

Mother Earth added, “It’s time they cry”;

“This means War, World War lll!”

Screamed the choked oceans, polluted skies and the remaining trees.<br><br>

First seed been sown in Wuhan,

Everyone was careless, ‘It could cause no harm!’

Stealthily and rapidly, it spread worldwide;

Across continents, shut the business tide.<br><br>

School shut, malls closed and countries locked.

’Ha! ‘, exclaimed Mother Earth, “Where were you when nature knocked?”

The war expanded with almost nothing untouched;

Masks our shield, soaps our weapon, but no cure rushed!<br><br>

People dying, migrant workers suffering;

To those in agony, no one is helping,

Mutating faster, this deadly virus;

’Will the world be finished?’ does it want this.<br><br>

Those raising voices were quietened;

Good doers were tormented,

The cause of this virus is us and only us;

When will the virus buzz!<br><br>

Mend your ways, oh mortal man!

Clean your beaches, forget your tan,

Work harder and stay sincere;

Be wise and have some fear!<br><br>

It’s time to give back to Nature, everything we owe her,

Slowly and steadily, we will survive this quintessential terror;

Forget the past, look at the future;

Mother Earth is calling us to nurture us is her gesture and nature!<br><br>
