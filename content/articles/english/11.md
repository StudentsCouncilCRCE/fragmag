For The Dawn and Deeps of Heaven's Reach

The Balance Is Thought upon

Old Virtues Of Their Preach<br><br>

For The Dawn and Deeps of Heaven's Reach

The Angel Is Brought upon

To Make a Buoyant Breachbr><br><br>

For The Dawn and Deeps of Heaven's Reach

The Devil is called upon

To Harm and Leechbr><br><br>

For The Dawn and Deeps of Heaven's Reach

Barter is set upon

To Cry and Beseechbr><br><br>

For The Dawn and Deeps of Heaven's Reach

Your Eleventh Hour is upon

No Desire Only a Screech<br><br>
