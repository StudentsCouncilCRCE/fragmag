After several nights, longing for a glimpse of the moon, I lay on my bed late at night as usual and I decided to listen to some songs that my dear friend had suggested to me.When I was about to press the play button, I saw some light from my bedroom's window falling on my hand. I kept my phone aside and followed that light which led me to the window, where I saw the moon glow the brightest that night with a small little star as a companion with it.

That was the day when I thought of listening to those songs that were her choice and were all saved in a playlist called, Moon.

That was the same day when I told my dear friend that I wanted to see her in the sky that day and I did.Because, to me she was always the moon and I was the little star to her.
