Childhood friendships are timeless,

With love and security even in silence,

Silence, as in when our common ground gets minus,

Because you know bonds don’t stop getting priceless.<br><br>

Yes, we don’t meet on a daily basis anymore,

No playing on grounds, or indoors,

No fighting with each other’s pages, scribbled or torn,

Just seeds of friendship in our hearts well sown.<br><br>

Buying chips together was the only hangout we needed,

At the same old spot, we had ourselves seated,

Those times when our cycles, as jewels we treated,

Most content, in a world of our own, that we created.<br><br>

I haven’t seen them now in ages,

Today, I just happened to turn my old pages,

Had them involved in almost all cases,

Happy, sad, exciting and sweet rages,<br><br>

Do they still feel the same way?

After we got ourselves drifted away,

But I’m sure that they’re going to stay,

In memories at least, cause ‘memories never change’ they say<br><br>
