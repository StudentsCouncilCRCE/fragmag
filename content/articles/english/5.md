Can a spark set ablaze

or our wish, get its ways?

Can a thought turn to deed

or our dreams, be paid heed?

Can we stand together for whatâ€™s right

and keep evil out of sight?

The answer is YES and it is true!

Hang on, read ahead to get a clue.

Let your confidence stand tall,

your courage not fall

and have patience to endure all.

Let your determination and willpower optimize,

so that all you do will alchemize.

Finally, you will know your life did catalyse!

This is true and everyone it will please!

Now, how about situations like these:

When darkness encompasses the earth

as the night slyly draws near.

When rumors spread like wildfire

and a virus attack snatches someone so dear.

what can I do, just sit with fear?

The answer is NO and it is clear!

Raise your hope and go on dear.

Be the cause

to spread love because

we can still pause

the malevolent clause

and bring peace across

lighting up our cosmos.
