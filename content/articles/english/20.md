The wind at night feels so surreal.

I mean, after all the stale, hot days, we finally feel the pleasant air; and on top of that, it’s dark- it’s night time.

It’s been so long since I’ve experienced this, that I’m emotional right now. It’s such a happy thing! I think this is how I’ll feel when I see the Milky Way for the first time. I know I will cry. It will be such an overwhelming moment. Just seeing all the stars and the entire galaxy out there- it just makes me feel so miniscule, so powerless; like a little dot who doesn’t even matter compared to the infinite stars and the scary yet beautiful universe out there.

As I wrote this, it started raining, drizzling, actually. It’s not even enough to make the roads wet, yet it brings tremendous joy.
