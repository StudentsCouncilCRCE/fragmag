Life is too short than we think,

Life is too fast than we blink.

You need to become a feather,

If you wanna stand in all sorts of weather.<br><br>

Everyone's born in storm,

No one's weak, no one's strong.

Life has legion tips to give,

It's up to you, what do you wanna perceive,

Get drown in voyage of hardships,

Or row with the courage of hardships.<br><br>

Look at the waterfall's height,

It's standing stiff to fright,

All ready to win the fight.

It's up to you,

Cry dreading the defeat,

Or die daring to kiss the victory's feet. <br><br>

Let's become a matchstick sack,

Let them pile up hellish haystack,

By misguiding every single anodizing misery,

We will inscribe a catalyzing history.<br><br>
