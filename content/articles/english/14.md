Grateful to all those, who made us understand the world

And live without the fear of the darkest evolutions

Let us reunite and set the glow in every soul

Because there is a warrior in every soul.<br><br>

Pray for the well-being and for our motherland,

Life is no less living, be brave and be bold

Time has come to bestow our best

Let us reunite and set the glow in every soul

Because there is a warrior in every soul.<br><br>

Days are moving though, ages are ripening

Stand on your ground still and let not be shaken apart

By the annoying disasters and disheartening rules,

Let us reunite and set the glow in every soul

Because there is a warrior in every soul<br><br>
