#### An Interview with Mr. Paresh Shetty

> Alumnus of Fr.CRCE

1. **How would you describe your journey through engineering at CRCE?<br>**
   I had a very lovely journey at CRCE. I was very active in all the events; I would say I was good in studies but not excellent at it. Engineering was never the first thing that I wanted to get into. It was Medicine or Army. I cleared the NDA entrance exam but due to my eyesight I couldn’t get through the medical interview. What was a sudden decision turned out to be the best because of the memories I made in CRCE. I would like to give due credits to my friends & to the faculty members. I was also the General Secretary of the Students’ Council for two years and Sports Secretary for a year which meant I had several responsibilities. These responsibilities helped me learn several things which I don’t think I would learn just through academics.

2. **What, according to you, differentiates Engineers from the rest?<br>**
   Engineers are always preferred over others primarily for their analytical thinking. The highly valued skill that is respected in every organisation is problem solving and the way one looks at it. Regardless of a Core Job or a Non-Core Job description, the most important task is to find a solution to the problem at hand and map a way to efficiently execute it. The way we Engineers look at a problem and find a solution to it is what differentiates us from others.

3. **What qualities of yours did you catalyse during your college days or at the start of your career to be who you are today?<br>**
   I am currently heading the Vodafone- Idea Enterprise business.  
   I was always an analytical thinker. I liked creating and innovating right from my college days. During engineering, I always lead a team when it comes to the planning and execution of an event. This helped me to develop my management skills and that helped to build the leader in me. I can proudly say that it is due to these things that I have been in a leadership role for over 14 years now.
   A mixture of both, the Engineering knowledge and the management skills, were the qualities I catalysed to be who am I today.

4. **Do you miss CRCE? Could you share a few special moments that made Engineering at CRCE a memorable experience?<br>**
   CRCE has a very special place in my heart. Whatever I am today is because of CRCE. Whenever I get an opportunity to contribute back, I love to! When I was in the Fourth year of my engineering that’s when the Principal suggested an idea of starting an Alumni Chapter in the college. We started off from that year and I am so ecstatic to share with you that since then I have not missed a single Alumni Meet except once when I was in Malaysia on a very important project.
   CRCE was, is and will always be special to me.

5. **What motivates you? What makes you go?<br>**
   I’ve been a self-Motivator most of the time. I set goals for myself and try to achieve them. My Wife & my kids too are a reason for my motivation. One thing an individual learns with time is that you must be your own Motivator and your own critic. Appreciate yourself if you feel you have achieved something, find the reason why you couldn’t achieve something.
   One must also understand the importance of “self-zone”, try to find the reasons that keep you happy. For me it’s sports that help me to rejuvenate. I love sports and I occupy myself in multiple sports. To reduce one stress, you have to take up another one. The biggest way of destressing is to take up a new stress.

6. **What message or advice would you like to convey to the students currently studying at CRCE?<br>**
   An all-round development is what every student must focus on. Do not miss a single opportunity that you get in CRCE because you won’t get them so easily in the Corporate World. Yes, they are available outside but they come with a price. Students must keep themselves open to the numerous fields and domains. It’s of the utmost importance to stay updated on the latest Technological Advancements. Trends are changing every 4-5 years and soon they will change even faster. One should be able to adapt based on the changing trends. Align yourselves on the different interest areas and make sure you ace it.
   When it comes to organisations, the ones with high digital power will survive. Digital Power will be the amalgamation of 4 main things. Technology, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things. Knowing these well or even having a gist of them will keep you a step ahead of others. Knowing the new trends is very important and thereby having a positive attitude towards these trends is also very important. If you wish to make it big in life then you must be willing to Learn, Unlearn & Relearn.
