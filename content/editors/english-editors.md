> Better to be a catalyst for change than a martyr for lies.

Everyone has an ability to change. Change what surrounds oneself and change what is inside oneself. But it is always the crossroads of the greater question that we always find ourselves at. Whether we change for good or for bad? For whom is this change good and for who is it not? The average citizen holds in his holster the power of this decision making. It ranges from a graduate looking for the decision in regards to the career to pursue, to the farmer who decides the fate of a nation by pressing a button during the elections. Everyone has the power to create change, for Good, for Bad, for the Past and for the Future. But do we exercise this right to change or has it just stayed out be an old fashioned notion?

Let us tell you a story. On the evening of December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks sat at the front of a bus in Alabama, heading home after a long day of work. During her journey, she was asked by a conductor to give up her seat to a white passenger. She refused and was arrested for disobeying an Alabama law requiring black people to relinquish seats to white people when the bus was full. Her arrest sparked a 381-day boycott of the Montgomery bus system. It also led to a 1956 Supreme Court decision banning segregation on public transportation. She always said that in the matter of a few seconds I had a decision to make. The decision of whether I want my kids and my eighty year old grandmother to live in a world where they have to oblige without consent, every single day and watch a white counterpart take away what is rightfully theirs. This thought that Rosa Parks had within those seconds, my friends is what we wish to define as a Catalyst.

Catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction and brings about change. But we believe that more than this, the point at which the catalyst enters the reaction that plays the pivotal role. It is at this point that we stand corrected with the understanding and conviction that the current circumstances are not what we wish for. The exact point which urges us to push towards change in the reaction. And exactly at this point is where we wish to Present Fragmag 2020.

We the English Editors, hope that Fragmag Edition 2020 urges you to move towards this change. It can be a small decision to start off with. But without doubt catalyse yourself towards that change. The road to success is a rough one with many twists and turns. But we hope that Fragmag inspires you to become the Catalysts of the World, not only for yourselves but for the progress and welfare of all those around you. Although it has been a tough time considering the scenario of the world, we the English Editors, hope to inspire every individual under its digital roof, through the contributions that the students and teachers have displayed. The most important message from Team FragMag would be, grab every opportunity at hand and never stop believing in you; no matter what the world has to say. Catalyse yourself and see the difference you make, not only in your life but also of those around you!
