> In the middle of difficulty lies, opportunity

Humble Greetings to you on behalf of the Editorial Board of FragMag 2020.

Change today is inevitable? Therefore, Humans are catalysing! When we decided on the theme for FragMag this year, I believed strongly that this theme needed a little bit more of an insight than what we had already at that point. But then all of us came across an insight. The insight that caused the world to catalyse and imbibe change in everything around them. The insight of COVID-19 which has had an unprecedented impact across the globe. Between scientists catalysing the process towards a speedy discovery of an effective vaccine and governments across the globe burning the midnight oil to curb the spread of the deadly virus, we humans realized that everything Changes. And thus the World changed its motto. From Just Do It, to, Do It, Now!

In Chemistry, there's a negative and a positive catalyst. The former one helps to reduce the rate of the chemical reaction while the latter one accelerates the speed of a reaction. The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly acted as a negative catalyst in terms of the global economic crisis. Still, it has in turn proved itself to be a positive catalyst to humans, imbibing in us a sense of responsibility & seriousness towards things we never considered severe. Who thought human health is more critical than investments and luxury? Who believed that social distancing in your humble abode would be the new vacation getaway? Our dearest Amchi Mumbai blessed us with a rare sight of dolphins swimming their heart out in the high seas. Who imagined one could even get to see dolphins in a bustling & chaotic city like Mumbai? Perhaps, the pandemic has given us that much-needed emergency break. Yes, ladies & gentlemen, it has taught us values that we could have never learnt or felt otherwise. It's said, "If you cannot learn the right way, learn the hard way". The current situation has imbibed in us a sense of taking things in life seriously. It has helped us to catalyse on our talents, skills and hobbies that were neglected due to a very common reason, “No Time”. I see bakers, chefs, painters, poets, musicians and various other talents oozing out from individuals who never believed they could dawn a new skill to their credit during the lockdown.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has created an adverse impact on humankind, it has brought in us a sense of understanding. "It might be stormy now, but the rain doesn't last forever". We're all stepping into a new normal, a normal that won't be like the one we were used to earlier. A new normal, where our priorities will change to things such as health, hygiene and the environment. A normal where mental health is considered seriously. If a pandemic like COVID-19 has the potential to wipe out the entire civilization, then ,we humans too, have the potential to withstand anything and unite as one to fight the battle.

I take this opportunity to thank Reverend Father Peter D’Souza, Reverend Father Valerian D’Souza and our Principal Dr. Srija Unnikrishnan for bestowing upon me their prayers and blessings. I would also like to acknowledge with gratitude the support I have received from Dr. Deepak Bhoir (Dean of Students Affairs). This magazine wouldn’t have been possible without the leadership and continuous encouragement I received from Dr. Ketaki Joshi, the Convener & In-charge of the Marathi section of this year’s edition. A hearty thanks to Prof. Deepika Singh (Hindi In-charge) & Dr. Joseph Rodrigues (English In-charge). A big thank you to the entire team of FragMag (Richa Tripathi, Varad Patil, Maria Anthony, Yohaan Mhatre, Gautam Manuel) for always helping me through this wonderful journey.

> Design is Intelligence made visible

The wonderful designs you will see in this Magazine have been done by none other than Jeswin Thomas. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Jeswin for all your efforts in making this year’s edition look attractive. How can I forget the entire Student’s Council who came up with their initiative towards a unique idea of digitally publishing this year’s edition. A Special thank you to our webmaster, Sakshi Ghadigaonkar and our ex-Technical Secretary, Ryan Dsilva for making a dedicated website for FragMag!

Lastly, to this person,who's always worked in silence and behind the screen. Yes, I am talking about Kevin Ruffin, the General Secretary of the Students’ Council and I consider myself as the luckiest Editorial Secretary because of the support I’ve always received from him. Thank you, Kevin for always having my back.

Today, to be in the privilege club doesn't mean owning a brand new car & having multiple investments but means being able to maintain social distancing. I call to mind the ones who are lesser 'privileged' than you & I, and I urge you to lend your helping hand in whatever way you can. Your kind help, love and support rendered would go a long way.

I am presenting to you the FragMag Edition of 2020! Wishing you all have an insightful experience.

Cheers to the New Normal!
