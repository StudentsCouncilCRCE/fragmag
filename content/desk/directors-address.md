Dear Students,

I am extremely happy to pen down these few lines for this year’s edition of FRAGMAG which provides an opportunity for our students to express their feelings in the form of articles, reports, poems etc. The Editorial Team of this year has chosen ‘Catalyse’ as the theme of FRAGMAG 2020.

Stephen R.Covey in his book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People says, ‘I am personally convinced that one person can be a change catalyst, a 'transformer' in any situation, any organization. Such an individual is yeast that can leaven an entire loaf. It requires vision, initiative, patience, respect, persistence, courage, and faith to be a transforming leader’.

CRCE offers a common platform for the students to make best use of the hidden talents and to hone their skills in various fields. It is an opening for everyone to be creative and innovative and to discover his or her own way forward. One has to be in learning mode all the time in order to taste success in life. This entails saying NO to the comfort zone. It is expected from everyone to maintain consistency to achieve the desired goals and objectives.

Dear Students in these uncertain times, Covid-19 has disrupted the life for everyone. However, as ironic as it may sound, every crisis is also the harbinger of opportunities. In the prevailing scenario, Technology has emerged as the biggest enabling tool to bridge distances and increase productivity. You have a great challenge before you to emerge victorious in all your endeavours. So accelerate and catalyse yourself to achieve your dream in near future.

Wishing you all the very best.
